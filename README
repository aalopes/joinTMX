= Description =

 Python script for joining several Tiled .tmx files into a single one.
 Useful for joining multiple small maps into bigger one, based on the 
 coordinates of the smaller maps. It takes as input a file with the size of 
 the big map as well as a list of coordinates of the the several small maps. 
 It will take care of making sure that all tilesets are put properly into the 
 final file even if two or more of the small maps use the same tileset but with
 different firstgids. It is also not problematic if the small maps use different
 sets of tilesets.
 The original version of this script was written for The Mana World 
 <https://www.themanaworld.org/>, such that some parts of it may still need
 to be modified for a more general application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
= Usage =

  Simply run:
  python joinTMX inpFile.inp
  
  The form of the inpFile should be:
  
  name   "bigMapName" "width" "height"
  offset "xOffset"  "yOffset"
  map    "mapOneName"  "x1" "y1"
  map    "mapTwoName"  "x2" "y2"
  ...
  
  where there can be as many map lines as necessary.
  For a sample .inp file, see the ./example folder.
